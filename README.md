# 🐻❄️ HiberFi: Your Verifiably Stable Resting Place on Berachain

Welcome to **HiberFi**, a next-generation stable DeFi ecosystem built for resilience and sustainable growth on **Berachain**. We combine innovative elastic tokenomics, a robust **HONEY-backed** central vault (**HoneyDen**), transparent governance assisted by AI insights, and rewarding opportunities for long-term participants. HiberFi is designed to be the reliable foundation for your crypto assets.

## 🍯 HONEYzzz (HONEYz): Stability Anchored to Real Value

**HONEYzzz** (symbol: `HONEYz`) is our flagship elastic-supply token, meticulously designed to maintain a stable peg to Berachain's native **HONEY** stablecoin.

- **Stable Peg Target:** Algorithmically guided towards a tight $0.99–$1.01 HONEY range.
- **Elastic Supply Adjustments:** Daily supply rebases (max ±2%, adjustable by governance) occur *only* if the Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) over the preceding epoch drifts outside the target range, gently guiding the price back towards peg.
- **Verifiable Backing:** Every HONEYz aims for **direct 1:1 backing** by real HONEY held securely within the **HoneyDen Vault**. This is *not* just an algorithmic promise; it’s backed by tangible assets.
- **Peg Resilience:** In extreme market conditions, additional stability mechanisms (e.g., vault buybacks or redemption limits) ensure peg resilience.

## 🏦 The HoneyDen Vault: The Heart of HiberFi's Stability

The HoneyDen Vault is the cornerstone of HONEYz’s stability and distinguishes HiberFi from purely algorithmic models.

- **Funding Sources:** Initially seeded by withdrawal fees during the Genesis Launch and sustained through:
  - **HoneyDen Stability Reserve (HSR)** fees.
  - Fees from HONEYz redemptions or Vault buyback/sell operations.
  - Strategic allocation of vested HIBER tokens (as decided by governance).
  - Yield generated by low-risk Berachain ecosystem strategies.
- **Target Collateralization Ratio (CR):** Strives for 100% CR. Transparent CR displayed on HiberFi dApp.
- **HoneyDen Growth Engine:** Vault reserves strategically deployed into low-risk, yield-bearing Berachain strategies, strengthening HONEYz backing.
- **Transparent Operations:** All activities publicly verifiable on-chain.

## 🎖️ HIBER: Governance, Rewards, and Long-Term Alignment

**HIBER** (symbol: `HIBER`) is the governance and reward token, empowering community-driven protocol decisions.

- **Max Supply:** 888 HIBER (extreme scarcity).
- **Distribution:** Linear distribution over 888 days:
  - **75% Liquidity Providers (666 HIBER):** Distributed through liquidity mining and staking rewards, guided by AI and governance.
  - **25% HoneyDen Vault (222 HIBER):** Linear vesting supporting long-term protocol health.

```

**HIBER** is the core governance and staking token of the **HiberFi Protocol**. Unlike many DeFi projects, HiberFi had **no pre-mine, no team allocations, and no VC funding**. Every token is community-distributed, aligning with the **BITCOIN SPIRIT**—true decentralization.

### 🚩 Fair Launch Commitment:

HiberFi commits to a **100% fair launch**:

- No governance tokens (HIBER) allocated to devs.
- Initial liquidity provided by devs won't farm HIBER; liquidity gradually withdrawn once community liquidity deepens.
- Only **5% of newly minted HONEYz** allocated to dev team during expansions for infrastructure and marketing, maintaining fairness.
