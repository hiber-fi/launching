# 🐻❄️ HiberFi: Your Verifiably Stable Resting Place on Berachain

Welcome to **HiberFi**, a next-generation stable DeFi ecosystem built for resilience and sustainable growth on **Berachain**. We combine innovative elastic tokenomics, a robust **HONEY-backed** central vault (**HoneyDen**), transparent governance assisted by AI insights, and rewarding opportunities for long-term participants. HiberFi is designed to be the reliable foundation for your crypto assets.

## 🍯 HONEYzzz (HONEYz): Stability Anchored to Real Value

**HONEYzzz** (symbol: `HONEYz`) is our flagship elastic-supply token, meticulously designed to maintain a stable peg to Berachain's native **HONEY** stablecoin.

- **Stable Peg Target:** Algorithmically guided towards a tight $0.99–$1.01 HONEY range.
- **Elastic Supply Adjustments:** Daily supply rebases (max ±2%, adjustable by governance) occur *only* if the Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) over the preceding epoch drifts outside the target range, gently guiding the price back towards peg.
- **Verifiable Backing:** Every HONEYz aims for **direct 1:1 backing** by real HONEY held securely within the **HoneyDen Vault**. This is *not* just an algorithmic promise; it’s backed by tangible assets.
- **Peg Resilience:** In extreme market conditions, additional stability mechanisms (e.g., vault buybacks or redemption limits) ensure peg resilience, detailed under Stability Mechanisms.

## 🏦 The HoneyDen Vault: The Heart of HiberFi's Stability

The HoneyDen Vault is the cornerstone of HONEYz’s stability and distinguishes HiberFi from purely algorithmic models.

- **Funding Sources:** Initially seeded by withdrawal fees during the Genesis Launch and sustained through:
  - A portion of **HoneyDen Stability Reserve (HSR)** fees.
  - Fees from HONEYz redemptions or Vault buyback/sell operations.
  - Strategic allocation of vested HIBER tokens (as decided by governance).
  - Potential yield generated by the vault itself.
- **Target Collateralization Ratio (CR):** Strives to maintain 100% CR. Transparent CR displayed on the HiberFi dApp.
- **HoneyDen Growth Engine:** Vault HONEY reserves may be deployed into low-risk, yield-bearing strategies within the Berachain ecosystem. Generated yield flows back to strengthen HONEYz backing over time.
- **Transparent Operations:** All vault activities publicly verifiable on-chain.

## 🎖️ HIBER: Governance, Rewards, and Long-Term Alignment

**HIBER** (symbol: `HIBER`) is the governance and reward token, empowering community-driven protocol decisions.

- **Max Supply:** 888 HIBER (extreme scarcity).
- **Distribution:** Total supply over 888 days:
  - **45% Liquidity Providers (400 HIBER)**: Distributed via emissions guided by AI and governance.
  - **45% HoneyDen Vault (400 HIBER)**: Linear vesting supporting long-term protocol health.
  - **9.9% Dev & Marketing (88 HIBER)**: Linear vesting ensuring team alignment.
